- Identify patterns such as product defects, delivery issues, or mismatched expectations.

#### 2. Improve Product Descriptions and Quality Control

- Ensure product listings are accurate and detailed to reduce misunderstandings.
- Strengthen quality assurance processes to minimize defective or misrepresented items.

#### 3. Engage High-Return Customers Directly

- Reach out to customers with frequent returns (e.g., **Jonathan Doherty**, **Tamara Dahlen**) to understand their experience.
- Offer support or personalized solutions to rebuild trust and reduce future returns.

#### 4. Monitor Return Trends by Segment

- Track return rates by customer segment (Corporate, Home Office, Consumer).
- Use this data to tailor return policies, improve service, and adjust inventory strategies.

#### 5. Introduce Return Threshold Alerts

- Set up internal alerts for customers with unusually high return activity.
- Flag accounts for review and proactive engagement before profitability is impacted.

Insight:

The analysis reveals that KMS is not allocating shipping costs effectively in relation to order priority‚Äîparticularly for time-sensitive orders.

#### Key Observations:

a. Misalignment for High and Critical Orders:

Delivery Truck, identified as the slowest yet most economical shipping method, accounts for the highest total shipping cost for both Critical and High priority orders. This contradicts the urgency these priorities imply.

Express Air, the fastest and most expensive option, has the lowest total shipping cost and lowest usage across all priority levels, including the most urgent ones. This underutilization suggests that speed is being sacrificed for cost, even when urgency is essential.

b. Overreliance on Regular Air:

Regular Air is used extensively across all priority levels, including Critical and High. While this may be acceptable for medium priorities, its dominance indicates that faster shipping methods like Express Air are not being leveraged where they are most needed.

c. Appropriate Spend for Lower Priorities:

For Low, Medium, and Not Specified priorities, the use of Delivery Truck and Regular Air is more justifiable. These methods align well with cost-saving goals for non-urgent shipments.

#### Recommendation:
KMS should re-evaluate its shipping strategy to ensure high-priority orders are aligned with faster delivery options like Express Air, even at a higher cost, to meet customer expectations and service standards.



### üìå Overall Strategic Recommendation for KMS Management

Based on the analysis of customer value, shipping efficiency, return behavior, and regional sales, the following strategic actions are recommended to improve profitability, customer retention, and operational efficiency:

#### üéØ 1. Deepen Engagement with High-Value Customers

- Prioritize top customers like **Adam Hart**, **Aaron Bergman**, and **Aaron Hawkins** with:
  - Dedicated account management
  - Personalized product recommendations
  - Loyalty incentives and early access to new offerings
- Monitor their purchase trends to identify upsell and cross-sell opportunities.

#### üöö 2. Align Shipping Methods with Order Priority

- **Critical and High priority orders** should rely more on **Express Air** and **Regular Air**, minimizing use of **Delivery Truck** due to its slower speed.
- **Medium and Low priority orders** are appropriately using more economical methods like **Delivery Truck**.
- Implement automated shipping logic to enforce alignment between urgency and delivery method.

#### üîÅ 3. Reduce High Return Rates

- Investigate high-return customers such as **Michael Dominguez** and **Anne Pryor** to understand root causes.
- Improve product descriptions, quality control, and post-purchase support.
- Set up alerts for accounts with excessive returns to enable proactive engagement.

#### üì¶ 4. Optimize Shipping Cost Efficiency

- Delivery Truck, while economical per unit, contributes significantly to total shipping costs due to volume.
- Regular Air offers a good balance of cost and speed‚Äîconsider shifting more volume here for non-urgent orders.
- Monitor average shipping cost per method and adjust logistics strategy accordingly.

#### üåç 5. Leverage Regional Sales Insights

- **Ontario** is a high-performing region with ‚Ç¶202,346.84 in total sales.
- Focus marketing and distribution efforts in this region to maintain momentum and explore expansion opportunities.

#### üìä 6. Build a Performance Dashboard

- Create a real-time dashboard to track:
  - Top customers and their product preferences
  - Shipping method usage by priority
  - Return rates by customer and segment
  - Regional sales performance
- Use this dashboard to support data-driven decision-making across departments.
